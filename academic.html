                <h3>Academic</h3>

                <p>I attend Fiorello H. Laguardia High School for the Performing Arts majoring on the violin. Even though this school focuses mainly on the arts, I have a balanced combination of academics and music. </p>

                <p>I have AP Environmental Science last period everyday and it's the class I look forward to the most. Being in this class enabled me to become more educated in the field of environmental science. This class focused on current crisis such as global warming and climate change. This changed my view on everything and lifestyle.</p>

                <p>Entering this class I thought we were going to learn about global warming and pollution. However, I started to think about all the unsustainable choices I have made previously and realized that this was a worldwide problem. After this class, I have decided to live a sustainable life.</p>

                <p>As you can see, I am extremely passionate about the wellness of Earth and the lifestyles of everyone. Continuing on the path of unsustainability will lead to worldwide injustices and potentially destruction. I want to advocate for a green world and encourage people to live healthy sustainable lifestyles.</p>

                <p>Other classes I take are AP Language and Composition, AP United States History, claculus, and three music classes. </p>

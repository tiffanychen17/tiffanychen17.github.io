                <h3>Extracurricular</h3>
                <p><h2>Music</h2></p>

                <p>I major on the violin in school. I started playing violin when I was 8 years old and I have enjoyed playing this instrument ever since. </p>

                <p>Throughout my journey I competed against other talented people. Playing an instrument does not only mean playing the instrument. I also had to know music theory and took lessons for 2 years on this subject. Music theory is basically the foundation of music. knowing that will definitely enhance one's knowledge on music.</p>

                <p>I also tested my skill in the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM). It was a great opportunity for me to challenge myself in learning two pieces and scales in a few months. It was a difficult time for me because to pass this test, I had to practice every single day for an hour or two. I dedicated most of my time on the violin and refreshing my knowledge on music theory.</p>
                <p><h3>Culture</h3></p>

                <p>I also immerse myself in my family language which is chinese. I attended chinese school since I was 6 years old. I recently graduated and I think I learned so much about the chinese culture and I actually understand traditions my family practice.</p>

                <p>Being in these two extracurriculars really shaped who I am and I can say that I really enjoyed these two impactful challenges in my life. </p>
